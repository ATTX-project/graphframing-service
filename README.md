## Graph Framing Service

Current directory contains:
* indexing-service implementation in `src/ldframe` folder

VERSION: `0.2`

### Docker container

Using the Graph Framing Service Docker container:
* `docker pull attxproject/ldframe-service:dev` in the current folder;
* running the container `docker run -d -p 4303:4303 attxproject/ldframe-service:dev` runs the container in detached mode on the `4302` port (production version should have this port hidden);
* using the endpoints `http://localhost:4303/{versionNb}/{endpoint}` or the other listed below.

The version number is specified in `src/ldframe/app.py` under `version` variable.

## Overview

The Graph Framing service take as an input an RDF graph (in Turtle format) and applies a JSON-LD frame and prepares the output to be indexed in Elasticsearch by extracting the document type and attaching an document ID for each RDF graph generated by the JSON-LD frame.

Full information on how to run and work with the Indexing Service available at: https://attx-project.github.io/Service-Graph-Framing.html

## API Endpoints

The Indexing REST API has the following endpoints:
* `health` - checks if the application is running.

## Develop

### Requirements
1. Python 2.7
2. Gradle 3.0+ https://gradle.org/
3. Pypi Ivy repository either a local one (see https://github.com/linkedin/pygradle/blob/master/docs/pivy-importer.md for more information) or you can deploy your own version using https://github.com/blankdots/ivy-pypi-repo

### Building the Artifact with Gradle

Install [gradle](https://gradle.org/install). The tasks available are listed below:

* do clean build: `gradle clean build`
* see tasks: `gradle tasks --all` and depenencies `gradle depenencies`
* see test coverage `gradle pytest coverage` it will generate a html report in `htmlcov`

### Run without Gradle

To run the server, please execute the following (preferably in a virtual environment):
```
pip install -r pinned.txt
python src/ldframe/frameservice.py server
python src/ldframe/frameservice.py rpc
```

For testing purposes the application requires a running Graph Manager Service, RabbitMQ. Also the health endpoint provides information on running services the service has detected: `http://localhost:4303/health`
